- as layer

5G Fragestellung:
"Is it possible to formally verify six
5G NAS layer procedures— initial registration, deregistration, paging,
configuration update, handover, and service request procedures and
the corresponding five RRC layer procedures— spanning across two
control-plane layers against relevant security and privacy properties?"
-> 6 NAS layer procedures correspond to 5 RRC layer procedures which again span over 2 control-plane layers (so control plane does exist out of multiple layers..?)
