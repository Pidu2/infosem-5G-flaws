Abkürzungen:
- NAS: Non-Access Stratum
- AS: Access Stratum
- RRC: Radio Resource Control
- UE: User Equipment (ex 5greasoner)
- TMSI: Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity
- IMSI: International Mobile Subscriber Identity
- SUPI: Subscription Permanent Identifier (called "5G IMSI" by jover)
- SUCI: Subscriber Concealed Identifier (SUPI encrypted with operator's public key http://www.techplayon.com/5g-identifiers-supi-and-suci/)
- 5G NR: 5G New Radio
- RAN: Radio Access Network (5greasoner: can be seen as the network between a UE and a gNB and also between communicating gNBs)
- CN: Core Network
- USIM: Universal Subscriber Identity Module (ex 5greasoner)
- gNB: gNodeB (5G base-station)
- AMF: Access and Mobility Management Function  (5greasoner: manages registration, detach procedures, paging and services related to registration, connection, and mobility)
- AUSF: Authentication Server Function (5greasoner: authentication and key agreement for registration procedure, stores the UE’s identities, keys and subscription data and UDM)
- UDM: Unified Data Management (5greasoner: responsible for generating Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) credentials)
- RNTI: Radio Network Temporary Identifier
- C-RNTI: It stands for Cell RNTI. It is a unique identification used for identifying RRC Connection and scheduling which is dedicated to a particular UE. The gNB assigns different C-RNTI values to different UEs. The gNB uses C-RNTI to allocate a UE with uplink grants, downlink assignments, etc. C-RNTI is used by gNB to differentiate uplink transmissions (e.g. PUSCH, PUCCH) of a UE from others.

3.4 erklärt das Modell mit welchem Angriffe gefunden werden recht gut

5G Fragestellung:
"Is it possible to formally verify six
5G NAS layer procedures— initial registration, deregistration, paging,
configuration update, handover, and service request procedures and
the corresponding five RRC layer procedures— spanning across two
control-plane layers against relevant security and privacy properties?"
-> 6 NAS layer procedures correspond to 5 RRC layer procedures which again span over 2 control-plane layers (so control plane does exist out of multiple layers..?)
Tested properties:
- Authenticity
- Availability
- Integrity
- Secrecy (of user sensitive information like location)
- Replay protection

Control Plane / User Plane:
- Control Plane carries signaling traffic (RRC, NAS)
- User Plane carries User data (closer to user, less latency) (RDCP, RLC, MAC, PHY)

NAS Layer Procedures:
- Initial Registration (genauer beschrieben in paper)
- Deregistration
- Configuration Update
- Service Request
RRC Layer Procedures:
- RRC Setup
- RRC Security Activation
- RRC Release
- RRC Connection Reconfiguration
- RRC Connection Resume
- RRC Connection Re-establishment
Paging Procedures:
- RAN Initiated Paging
- CN Initiated Paging
